open three terminals

Run server.js by node server.js (or you can use npm start).
    > node server.js
        OR
    > npm start

to run client, you've to pass name and mode as a command line argument.

in one terminal (to set mode to streaming), 
    
    > node client.js Vrushank stream

in another terminal (to set mode to polling),

    > node client.js Mihir poll

Once chat is started, these both clients can communicate with each other,
You'll notice that streaming mode will show you message immediately after other client send it.
but polling will take 3 seconds to show the message up (because we've set setInterval of polling to 3000 in client.js).

In some use cases, polling is better than streaming. Ex. weather app.
Similarly, in some other scenarios, streaming is better than polling. Ex. chat app.
