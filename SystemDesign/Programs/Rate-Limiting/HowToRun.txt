open cmd or terminal and run server.js by 
    > node server.js

Now open another terminal or cmd and curl as below (replace {YOUR_NAME} by your name)
    > curl -H 'user={YOUR_NAME}' localhost:3000/index.html 
    OR
Open your favourite browser and open this url : http://localhost:3000/index.html?user=vrushank

now, in both the cases, you'll get Hello world, but only once in 5 seconds.
In 5 seconds, if you issue another request, it'll return an error 429 and say "Too many requests".
